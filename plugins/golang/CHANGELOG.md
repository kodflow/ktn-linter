### Rationale

**Before v2.1.0** - Plugin was missing critical API layer patterns:
- ‚ùå No DTO patterns (security risk!)
- ‚ùå Domain models exposed directly in APIs
- ‚ùå No validation patterns for HTTP requests
- ‚ùå No API versioning guidance
- ‚ùå No mapper function patterns
- ‚ùå Old WaitGroup patterns throughout reference-service

**After v2.1.0** - Complete API layer standards:
- ‚úÖ Complete DTO patterns (9 subsections)
- ‚úÖ Security-first approach (hide sensitive fields)
- ‚úÖ Request validation with binding tags
- ‚úÖ API versioning with separate DTOs
- ‚úÖ Mapper functions for transformation
- ‚úÖ Complete working HTTP server example
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive handler tests
- ‚úÖ All WaitGroup patterns migrated to Go 1.25
- ‚úÖ README updated with HTTP/DTO section
- ‚úÖ 100% reference-service compliance

**Coverage Summary:**
- **HTTP/DTO Patterns**: 9 critical patterns added (Section 21)
- **Working Example**: Complete HTTP server with CRUD operations
- **Test Coverage**: 100% handler test coverage
- **WaitGroup Migration**: 50+ occurrences fixed across 16 files
- **Documentation**: ~280 lines of HTTP/DTO documentation in README
- **Total Standards**: 313+ checkpoints (was 283+)
- **All patterns are mandatory standards for production APIs**

**Security Impact:**
- üîí Prevents password hash leakage in API responses
- üîí Hides soft delete timestamps from clients
- üîí Prevents internal field exposure
- üîí Type-safe validation prevents injection attacks
- üîí API versioning prevents breaking changes

## [2.0.6] - 2025-10-11

### Added

#### Hidden Allocation Patterns (Mandatory Standards)

**3 Critical Memory Optimization Patterns Added:**

1. **Return by Value When Possible** - Section 6.9
   - Small structs (< 64 bytes) should be returned by value
   - Returning pointers unnecessarily causes heap allocations
   - Rule of thumb: value for immutable small structs, pointer for large (> 64 bytes)
   - Example: Point struct (16 bytes) returned by value avoids GC pressure
   - **Location**: review.md lines 600-632

2. **Avoid Closure Variable Capture** - Section 6.10
   - Loop variables captured by closures escape to heap
   - Causes allocations + race conditions
   - Pass loop variables as function parameters
   - Go 1.22+ shadow variable pattern: `i := i`
   - Performance impact: Each captured variable = 1 heap allocation + potential race
   - **Location**: review.md lines 634-682

3. **Avoid Hidden String/[]byte Conversions** - Section 6.11
   - `string(byteSlice)` and `[]byte(string)` always allocate
   - Conversions copy data to heap every time
   - Use `strings.Builder` to minimize conversions
   - Performance impact: Each conversion = 1 allocation + data copy
   - **Location**: review.md lines 684-732

#### Go 1.25 Type System Enhancement

4. **reflect.TypeAssert[T] - Zero-Allocation Type Assertions** - Section 4
   - Go 1.25+ zero-allocation typed reflection
   - Replaces interface{} boxing with typed extraction
   - Performance: Zero allocations vs 1-2 allocations per assertion
   - Use case: Hot paths with reflection, type switches on interfaces
   - **Location**: review.md lines 287-309

### Changed

#### Review Command Enhancement
- **Hidden allocation patterns** now part of mandatory review checklist
- **3 new allocation optimization checkpoints** in Memory & Performance section (Section 6)
- **1 new Go 1.25 checkpoint** in Types & Interfaces section (Section 4)

#### Documentation Structure
- All patterns include "‚ùå WRONG" vs "‚úÖ CORRECT" examples
- Performance impact documented for each pattern
- Real-world use cases provided
- Rules of thumb for when to apply patterns

### Rationale

**Before v2.0.6** - Plugin was missing critical allocation patterns from "Go Faster With Less" article:
- ‚ùå No return by value vs pointer guidance
- ‚ùå No closure variable capture warnings
- ‚ùå No string/[]byte conversion allocation warnings
- ‚ùå No reflect.TypeAssert[T] (Go 1.25 feature)

**After v2.0.6** - Complete allocation optimization coverage:
- ‚úÖ Return by value pattern for small structs
- ‚úÖ Closure capture warnings with race condition examples
- ‚úÖ String/[]byte conversion optimization patterns
- ‚úÖ reflect.TypeAssert[T] for zero-allocation type assertions

**Coverage Summary:**
- **Hidden Allocation Patterns**: 3 critical patterns added
- **Go 1.25 Features**: 1 additional feature (reflect.TypeAssert[T])
- **Total Allocation Patterns**: 11 patterns (complete coverage)
- **All patterns are mandatory standards - not optional optimizations**

## [2.0.4] - 2025-10-11

### Fixed

#### 1:1 Test File Mapping Compliance Achieved ‚úÖ

**Test Files - Complete 1:1 Mapping (100% Compliant)**
- **Created 21 new test files** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
  - All production files now have corresponding test files
  - Perfect 1:1 mapping: 31 production files ‚Üî 31 test files
  - Files created: batch_processor_test.go, pool_stats_test.go, tracked_pool_test.go, task_encoder_test.go, stats_snapshot_test.go, task_cache_test.go, status_index_test.go, session_store_test.go, session_test.go, worker_registry_test.go, worker_info_test.go, route_cache_test.go, resettable_once_test.go, global_registry_test.go, config_loader_test.go, connection_test.go, connection_pool_test.go, metrics_collector_test.go, service_registry_test.go, context_patterns_test.go, iterators_test.go

**Deleted Old Multi-Component Test Files**
- **Removed sync_pool_test.go** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
  - Tests were split into separate files matching the 1:1 rule
  - Each component (BatchProcessor, TrackedPool, TaskEncoder, PoolStats) now has its own test file

### Changed

#### File Structure
- **Before**: 31 production files, 10 test files (missing 21 test files)
- **After**: 31 production files, 31 test files (100% compliance: 1:1 mapping)
- **Result**: Every production .go file has a corresponding _test.go file

#### Test Coverage
- Comprehensive tests for all sync.Map components (TaskCache, StatusIndex, SessionStore, WorkerRegistry, RouteCache)
- Comprehensive tests for all sync.Once components (GlobalRegistry, ConfigLoader, ConnectionPool, MetricsCollector, ServiceRegistry, ResettableOnce)
- Comprehensive tests for sync.Pool components (TaskEncoder, BatchProcessor, TrackedPool, PoolStats)
- Comprehensive tests for advanced patterns (context_patterns.go, iterators.go)
- All tests use `package xxx_test` (black-box testing)
- All tests use `t.Parallel()` for concurrent execution

#### Review Command Enhancement
- **Added Phase 2.6: 1:1 TEST FILE MAPPING** check
  - Command to detect missing test files
  - Table format showing test file status
  - Template for creating missing test files
- **Updated Phase 3: File Structure Check**
  - Emphasized 1:1 test file mapping requirement
- **Updated rejection criteria**
  - Missing test files now cause immediate rejection

### Rationale

**Before v2.0.4** - Reference-service was PARTIALLY COMPLIANT:
- ‚úÖ 100% of test files compliant (no Package Descriptors)
- ‚úÖ No duplicate types
- ‚úÖ 100% file structure compliance (1 file per struct)
- ‚ùå Only 32% test file coverage (10 test files for 31 production files)

**After v2.0.4** - Reference-service is FULLY COMPLIANT:
- ‚úÖ 100% of test files compliant (no Package Descriptors)
- ‚úÖ No duplicate types
- ‚úÖ 100% file structure compliance (1 file per struct)
- ‚úÖ 100% test file coverage (31 test files for 31 production files)

The reference-service now properly demonstrates complete test coverage with 1:1 file mapping, ensuring every production file has its own dedicated test file.

## [2.0.3] - 2025-10-11

### Fixed

#### Reference-Service Full Compliance Achieved ‚úÖ

**Test Files - Package Descriptors Removed (100% Compliant)**
- **Removed Package Descriptors from ALL 10 test files** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
  - All test files (`*_test.go`) now comply with Phase 2.5 rule
  - Test files with `package xxx_test` no longer have Package Descriptors
  - Files fixed: task_test.go, worker_test.go, interfaces_test.go, constants_test.go, errors_test.go, stats_test.go, sync_pool_test.go, task_request_test.go, task_result_test.go, task_status_test.go, worker_config_test.go

**Duplicate Types Eliminated (100% Compliant)**
- **Fixed duplicate WorkerConfig type** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
  - Removed duplicate `type WorkerConfig struct` from worker.go (line 39)
  - WorkerConfig now exists only in worker_config.go (canonical location)
  - Eliminates type redefinition violation

**File Structure - "1 File Per Struct" Rule (100% Compliant)**

1. **stats.go split into 2 files** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
   - Created: `stats_snapshot.go` (StatsSnapshot struct)
   - Kept: `stats.go` (WorkerStats struct only)

2. **sync_pool.go split into 4 files** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
   - Created: `batch_processor.go` (BatchProcessor struct)
   - Created: `pool_stats.go` (PoolStats struct)
   - Created: `tracked_pool.go` (TrackedPool struct)
   - Renamed & cleaned: `task_encoder.go` (TaskEncoder struct + shared pools)

3. **sync_once.go split into 7 files** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
   - Created: `global_registry.go` (GlobalRegistry struct)
   - Created: `connection_pool.go` (ConnectionPool struct)
   - Created: `connection.go` (Connection struct)
   - Created: `config_loader.go` (ConfigLoader struct)
   - Created: `metrics_collector.go` (MetricsCollector struct - implementation)
   - Created: `service_registry.go` (ServiceRegistry struct)
   - Created: `resettable_once.go` (ResettableOnce struct)
   - Deleted: `sync_once.go` (fully extracted)

4. **sync_map.go split into 7 files** ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
   - Created: `task_cache.go` (TaskCache struct)
   - Created: `status_index.go` (StatusIndex struct)
   - Created: `session_store.go` (SessionStore struct)
   - Created: `session.go` (Session struct)
   - Created: `worker_registry.go` (WorkerRegistry struct)
   - Created: `worker_info.go` (WorkerInfo struct)
   - Created: `route_cache.go` (RouteCache struct)
   - Deleted: `sync_map.go` (fully extracted)

**Total New Files**: 18 new files created from 4 multi-struct files

### Changed

#### File Structure
- **Before**: 15 production files (7 with multiple structs)
- **After**: 33 production files (100% compliance: 1 file per struct)
- **Result**: Perfect 1:1 file-to-struct mapping throughout codebase

#### Package Descriptors
- All 18 new files have customized Package Descriptors
- Each Package Descriptor updated with:
  - Specific **Purpose** for the single struct
  - Specific **Responsibilities** for that struct's duties
  - Appropriate **Features** and **Constraints**

### Rationale

**Before v2.0.3** - Reference-service was NON-COMPLIANT:
- ‚ùå 100% of test files had Package Descriptors (should be 0%)
- ‚ùå Duplicate WorkerConfig type across 2 files
- ‚ùå 53% file structure compliance (8/15 files correct, 7 violated "1 file per struct")

**After v2.0.3** - Reference-service is FULLY COMPLIANT:
- ‚úÖ 100% of test files compliant (0 Package Descriptors)
- ‚úÖ No duplicate types (WorkerConfig in 1 location only)
- ‚úÖ 100% file structure compliance (33/33 files follow "1 file per struct")

The reference-service now properly demonstrates ALL golang plugin standards without exceptions.

## [2.0.2] - 2025-10-11

### Fixed

#### Package Descriptor Exception for Test Files
- **Excluded `*_test.go` files** from Package Descriptor requirement
  - Test files with `package xxx_test` are external to the package (black-box testing)
  - No longer need package-level documentation
  - Reduces false positives in review process

#### Documentation Updates
- **commands/review.md**:
  - Section 3.1: Added explicit exception for `*_test.go` files with `package xxx_test`
  - Phase 2: Updated command to skip test files (`-not -name "*_test.go"`)
  - Phase 2: Updated table to show test files as "‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped"
  - Added rationale: "Test files are external to package, not part of public API"

### Rationale

Test files with `package xxx_test` are:
- ‚úÖ External to the package (black-box testing)
- ‚úÖ Not part of the package's public API
- ‚úÖ Never compiled into the binary
- ‚úÖ Only exist for testing purposes

Therefore, they should **NOT** require Package Descriptors, which are meant to document package-level responsibilities and features.

## [2.0.1] - 2025-10-11

### üö´ Benchmark Policy (Breaking Process Change)

This release **REMOVES ALL BENCHMARKS** from the codebase and establishes a **ZERO BENCHMARKS IN COMMITS** policy.

### Removed

- **ALL `Benchmark*` functions** from test files
  - `sync_pool_test.go`: Removed 11 benchmark functions
  - `stats_test.go`: Removed 4 benchmark functions
- Benchmarks are now **TEMPORARY TOOLS ONLY** - written locally for POC/optimization, then **DELETED before commit**

### Changed

#### Benchmark Policy (NEW)
- ‚ùå **ZERO benchmarks in committed code** (Required)
- ‚úÖ Write benchmarks TEMPORARILY for local performance validation
- ‚úÖ Run benchmarks locally to prove optimizations
- ‚úÖ DELETE all benchmarks before committing
- ‚úÖ Document performance improvements in commit messages (e.g., "3x faster via sync.Pool")

#### Documentation Updates
- **GO_STANDARDS.md**: Added Important benchmark policy section
  - Not allowed: Benchmarks in committed code
  - Not allowed: Separate `*_bench.go` files
  - POLICY: Benchmarks are temporary POC tools only
- **commands/review.md**: Added benchmark violation checkpoints
  - Not allowed: `Benchmark*` functions in commits
  - POLICY: DELETE benchmarks before commit
- **reference-service/README.md**: Updated performance notes
  - Changed "Benchmark Results" to "Performance Results"
  - Added note that benchmarks are temporary tools
- **performance-optimizer agent**: Added NEVER COMMIT BENCHMARKS policy

#### Updated Standards
- Common violations list now includes "Committed benchmarks" (#5)
- Review checklist includes benchmark deletion verification
- Performance optimizer must never commit benchmarks

### Rationale

Benchmarks are **development tools** for proving optimizations during POC work:
- ‚úÖ Write benchmarks to validate "3x faster" claims
- ‚úÖ Use benchmarks to compare approaches
- ‚úÖ Run benchmarks locally to measure improvements
- ‚ùå DO NOT commit benchmarks to repository
- ‚úÖ Document proven improvements in commit messages

**Result**: Cleaner codebase, no benchmark maintenance burden, proven performance claims documented in commits.
